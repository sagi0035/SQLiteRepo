# SQLiteRepo
This app utilises SQLite to list football team's successes. <br />
It includes methods for adding to the database, deleting from the database and in turn listing all database items which are in turn placed into an array adapter.<br />
It of course utilises ContentValues to create key/value pairs which are used to add to the database.
